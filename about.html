 <div class="text1">
  <p>
   United Nations (UN) is an organization created in 1945, shortly after the end of WWII.
   The UN was formed by 51 countries in order to encourage resolution of international conflicts without war and to form policies on international issues.
   Today, however, there are 193 member countries, which includes most of the countries around the world.

   United Nations consist of six principal organs: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat.
   The United Nations family, however, is much larger, encompassing 15 agencies and several programmes and bodies
